# We have designed the CMakeLists.txt for building HeCBench with clang/clang++, as we use
# clang-specific flags. We originally had it working with NVCC, but for simplification
# purposes we stick to clang. You may be able to get it working with NVCC, just will
# need to adjust some build flags for the compilation (which we've left commented
# in the CMakeLists.txt file)

# If you're having issues building, it's most likely due to include order issues.
# Add `-H` to the build flags to see what include files are being added and 
# in what order the include directories get searched at build time.
# For example, you can use `make target-name 2>&1 | grep -ni "math.h"` to find the instances
# of the math header being included and decide if clang is including the correct one

# You may need to adjust the order of included directories like we do for Lassen
# below. Adding the `-nobuiltininc` gets rid of a lot of auto system directories
# that clang tries to smartly add. Then you can go in an add the directories yourself
# as we do below.  

# for some reason on lassen, clang is struggling to properly order the include
# directories at build time, so we need to forcibly set the correct directories
